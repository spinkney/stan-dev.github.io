## Acknowledgements {-}

Stan has grown from a small research project started in 2011 at Columbia University
to a global community of developers, researchers, and users.
The Stan project owes its success to the contributions from hundreds of
developers, researchers, active users, and funders.
Individual contributions to the software and documentation can be tracked through GitHub.

Stan has been funded through grants for Stan and its developers,
through in-kind donations in the form of companies contributing
developer time to Stan and individuals contributing their own time to
Stan, and through donations to the open-source scientific software
non-profit NumFOCUS.

We are grateful to all the users who have taken the time to file bug reports and
feature requests via the GitHub and the Stan forums; this feedback has greatly
improved Stan's usability and reliability.
